    <label>The Skip</label>
    <description>This vessel design was conceived after a nearby colony on this world tried their own version of a superpod. They decided to dismantle the pods and put them together uniquely. It turned out quite well, and has since become a popular dedsign due to its cheap material cost and reliable transport capabilities. \n\nHas military potential.</description>

    <description>A large aerial transport freighter. We don't know the history of these ships, but we do know they're found everywhere on the homeworlds. What it lacks on in chemfuel mileage and speed, it makes up for with it's vast cargo hold.</description>

    <description>A large aerial transport freighter. The TEK-7 class space-faring ship is rather new. It's powered by classical means, but uses modern technology to achieve more than it's predecessors.\n\nTerra Enclave Kingdrone - 7th Variation, Year 4186. This class has seen much combat, through many model variations each specialized in specific roles. \n\nTEK-7 is designated as a transport carrier.</description>

    <description>The Albatross X-11 was originally designed for military exoplanetary exploration, but was quickly replaced by a newer ship model with a much better engine system. You can find X-11 parts across the galaxy at typically low prices. It's natural design could easily be changed for atmospheric flight. \n\n Definitely has military potential.</description>

    <label>The Phoenix</label>
    <description>After years of research we finally discovered something special: a new technique originally used by an exctinct alien civilization used in the process of ship making.\n\nThis process infuses the ship with a "mystical" neuromesh technology while using fewer materials in the build. The new model is light, spacious, and hauls serious ass compared to the Albatross.\n\nThe schematics show serious military capability.</description>

    <description>The SRTS Mk.4: Genesis is a highly advanced transport shuttle that utilizes uranium for fuel.

This is "Blue box" level stuff.\n\nSome of the technologies contained within this vessel seem to defy all known laws of physics. We need to get our hands on them.</description>
